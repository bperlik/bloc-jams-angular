# Playtune-Angular
A Project created to learn Frontend Web Development

## Summary
This was my first project. I set out to build this tune player spa, a replica of Spotify, with the guidance of a Bloc mentor. The application was a vehicle to learn basic HTML and CSS, as well as front-end programming using vanilla JavaScript and AngularJS. I learned a lot through this process and encountered some interesting challenges.

## Tools
Playtunes-angular is built with HTML/CSS, JavaScript, and AngularJS

The organization of the project is as follows:
